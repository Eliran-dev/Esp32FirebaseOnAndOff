# Esp32FirebaseOnAndOff
In this project i will show share how i easily managed to connect an esp32 to Firebase database. Why? because using that simple code you can control smart home electronics, write logs, get permissions and more.
In this example i controled an electric lock using Firebase database (Entry request recieved through a react native app i will post in the near future),
at the same time an rfid reader is enabled and can also read rfid card and allow entry to the ones that have been given the right permissions through Firebase.
